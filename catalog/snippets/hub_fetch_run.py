"""Fetch a ptr727/ProjectTemplate script fresh from `main` and run it through uv.

Never pinned or vendored: a pin nothing keeps current goes stale by construction.
CI (this repo's own, and the hub's) is the backstop for a change that lands broken on `main`.
A fetch failure fails the caller loudly rather than silently skipping the gate it guards.
The script runs as `uv run --no-project --script`.
The packages its PEP 723 block declares therefore resolve, beside the data files it reads, which are fetched from the same ref.
Usage: hub_fetch_run.py <hub-relative-path> [script-args...]
Example: hub_fetch_run.py .github/actions/prose-gate/prose_lint.py --diff-commit -- <paths>
On SIGINT or SIGTERM it stops the script, removes the fetched tree, and re-raises the signal.
